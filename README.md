## My process

During the development of this project, I practiced important React concepts such as state, state immutability, lists and keys in ReactJS, props, and componentization. Additionally, I deepened my understanding of array manipulation methods like map and filter. I also had the opportunity to practice TypeScript by implementing static typing in my code.
